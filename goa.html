	<b>Goa</b> has, over the past decade, emerged as a hotbed for destination weddings in India. 
	This comes as no surprise, given the stellar locations one gets to choose from at this balmy beach destination. 
	Warm, tropical and hence inviting to many a couple, Goa fits the bill for the destination wedding neatly, with facilities made available across a number of different locations. 
	We&#39;re here to give you the low down on reasons why Goa shines as a wedding destination.
	<br><br><b>Peaceful and romantic</b>
	<br>Goa is a place that has lush of greenery, scenic beauty and most importantly the beaches. 
	All these factors are indeed necessary for a picture perfect wedding. 
	Getting married in Goa contributes to the romantic relationship of the couple and the Goan culture adds to the celebration. 
	Who doesn&#39;t want to exchange wedding vows amidst the greenery, in the sea shore, open skies and cool breeze? The feeling is really amazing.
	<br><b>Doubles as a Holiday for Your Guests</b>
	<br>Have friends who like to party? Then Goa would be a haven for your wedding guests, no doubt! Give people one more reason to attend, by hosting your wedding at a popular holiday location such as Goa. 
	Young children â€” and we bet your friends have some &#45; too will love this seaside option &#45; the land of the sun, sand and sea!
	<br><b>Save on Decor!</b>
	<br>Now down to the practicalities &#45; the cost. 
	Cut down cost by choosing a destination wedding? Counter-intuitive, perhaps but every bit true. 
	With a location as picturesque as Goa &#45; with its lilting waters and waving palm fronds &#45; needs very little to spruce it up. 
	In fact, a wedding here with just minimal decorations would mean you are doing the best to highlight the destination itself. 
	With minimal decorations of course comes minimal cost &#45; splurge your savings or save them, as your heart desires!

	<br><b><u>1:30 pm</u></b><br><u>Couple&#39;s Session | 45 Minutes</u>
	<br>This is another opportunity for your photographer to get some more shots as a couple, except now you are a married couple! 
	45 minutes is the suggested time for this, but more time can always be allocated to allow for more time and more extravagant photos, or different locations.
	<br><b><u>2:15 pm</u></b><br>Bride and Groom Downtime
	<br><b><u>2:45 pm</u></b><br><u>Re-Do Hair/Touch-Up Makeup for Reception | 1 Hour and 15 Minutes</u>

	<br><b><u>4:00 pm</u></b><br><u>Get Dressed for Reception | 15 Minutes</u>
	<br><b><u>4:15 pm</u></b><br><u>Family Portraits | 45 Minutes</u>
	<br>This is another opportunity to get photos with your family in their formal wear for the reception. 
	It&#39;s important to allow enough time for all the portraits you would like so that it does not cut into your nighttime couple&#39;s session.
	<br><b><u>5:00 pm</u></b><br><u>Photographs of Cocktail Details and Guests Mingling | 45 Minutes</u>
	<br><b><u>5:30 pm</u></b><br><u>Cocktail Hour | 1 Hour</u>

	<br><b><u>5:00 pm</u></b><br><u>Nighttime/Reception Couple&#39;s Session | 1 Hour</u> (At Least)
	<br>This is when we get some of the sunset/nighttime shots that are Lin and Jirsa&#39;s signature look. 
	Be sure to allow enough time for this photo session to travel around your reception site&#39;s premises. 
	We also like to get photos of just the bride and groom in the reception hall before guests enter. 
	Be sure to let your photographer know if you want to attend part of your cocktail hour to mingle with guests so that your Indian Wedding Timeline can accommodate this.
	<br><b><u>5:45 pm</u></b><br><u>Photographs of Reception Details | 45 Minutes</u>
	<br><b><u>6:45pm</u></b><br><u>Doors Open to Reception</u>

	<br><b><u>7:00-9:30</u></b><br><u>Dinner, Programming, Performances, Speeches</u>
	<br>This time in the reception is allotted for whatever programming you have planned. 
	Often times in Indian Wedding Timelines there are multiple dancing performances by professional dancers, performers, and family. 
	This is a good time for speeches from family and the Maid of Honor and Best Man. 
	Usually, the first dance and family dances occur during this time as well, before the dance floor is opened to all the guests.
	<br><b><u>9:30</u></b><br><u>Open Dance floor</u>
	<br>It&#39;s time for everyone to party! This is a good time for the first power dance set. 
	At this point, your guests are ready to stretch their legs and get their blood pumping.
	<br><b><u>10:00 pm</u></b><br><u>Sneak Away Session | 20 Minutes</u>
	<br>This is the last couples session to photograph. 
	It will have been completely dark now and it is time for us to capture the closing moments of your wedding day. 
	It&#39;s good to find locations with interesting light and landscapes. 
	Things like mirrored rooms, city scapes, fountains and bodies of water reflect light well and can cause some really incredible nighttime shots before you and your new spouse go on to your happily ever after.
	<br><b><u>10:30 pm</u></b><br><u>Cake Cutting Ceremony/Dessert</u>
	<br>This signifies to your guests that the reception will be ending soon. 
	Some weddings choose to also include late night food options for their guests at this time to keep the party going even later into the night!
	<br><b><u>10:45</u></b><br><u>Dancing continues</u>
